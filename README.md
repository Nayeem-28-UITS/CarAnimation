# CarAnimation

The Car Animation project uses C++ and the graphics.h library to create a dynamic 2D environment. It features a moving car on a road with lane markings, surrounded by a cloudy sky, multi-story buildings, trees, grass, and flowers. By showcasing basic animation and rendering techniques, it serves as a practical introduction to computer graphics programming.
